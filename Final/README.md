I enjoyed learning about GitHub and the processes of organizing web content/file structure. There was so much more behind the scenes to web development than I anticipated.

I also enjoyed learning about the practices of web design. One of the biggest things I took away was the importance of design for people with disabilities. There are many things that we as web designers can do to improve experiences for people with disabilities, like color blindness, online.

For this assignment I first decided that I would make a visitor's page for Lake Tahoe. Then I decided the general theme I would go for; simple with blue accents and beautiful images. Then I began to pick and pull from my previous assignments to make it all come together.
