### Head and Body Elements
A document should only have one head element and one body element, but within each of these it can have many other elements. For example, the head element can contain many different meta and style elements.  

### Structural and Semantic Markup
Structural markup determines the way the document will be setup, i.e. headings, paragraphs, breaks, and lists. On the other hand, semantic markup mainly addresses the way text appears. This includes: italics, superscript/subscript, strikethrough, abbreviations, etc.
