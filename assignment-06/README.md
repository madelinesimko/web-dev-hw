###Forms
A common form that I encounter on a regular basis is the text entry form. This is the type of form you might use when you're inputing personal information to purchase something online. I also commonly encounter the file upload form when I am using Moodle to upload homework assignments.

###Examples of text, selection, and button input
An example of a text form is when you have to input a username and password to login to a website. You might encounter a selection form on a poll that gives you several different options that you must select from. A file upload form, as previously described, is an example of a button.

###Work Cycle Summary
I began this assignment first by working on the README and reviewing the information in Module 6. Then I went ahead and worked on the index.html coding.
