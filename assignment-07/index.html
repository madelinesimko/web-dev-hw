      <h2>Lyrics</h2>
      <p>
        She got attacked by a pack of dogs <br />
        But she said, 'It's okay  <br />
        I got some wilderness skills beneath mym belt' <br />
        She said she used to be a part of a Scout team <br />
        They nearly made her leader one time <br />
        But they didn't have enough thread to sew the patches on <br />
        And she said, 'Do you know how you heard <br />
        About that family that burnt down in that house?' <br />
        Well, that was hers <br />
        She said it was jsut some hoax that she made up <br />
        To watch people cry <br />
        Yeah, she whispered to me softly <br />

        Well, do you want me <br />
        Just how I am? <br />
        Do you need me <br />
        Where I stand? <br />
        Let's go steady <br />
        Let's make a plan <br />
        Marinade on that for a while <br />
        Yeah <br />

        She wanted to die by a river <br />
        She wanted the tide to come up and drag her away <br />
        So that when she's dreamin' <br />
        She can watch the tree line fall away <br />
        She used to draw rainbow faces in the sand <br />
        But the rainbow made the face sad <br />
        Had bits of foam coming out the bottom of its mouth <br />
        It's kinda funny that way <br />

        Oh, do you want me Oh, do you want me <br />
        How I am? <br />
        Do you need me <br />
        Oh, where I stand? <br />
        Let's go steady <br />
        Let's make a plan <br />
        Marinade on that for a little while <br />
        Yeah <br />
