# Assignment 2
## Madeline Simko

I decided to take this course because I am very interested in graphic design. I have done a bit of web design for several nonprofits using services such as Squarespace and Wix. I am excited to learn about more sophisticated forms of web design through this course.

## I hope to learn:
- How to create a website that is visually pleasing
- How to create a website that people want to return to
- How to create a website that maximizes usability
